# ssh

## Secure shell (ssh)

* A secure tool for connecting and interacting with remote systems
* Uses session based or public key encryption
* Run a single command or work interactively
* Lots of other neat tricks (proxying, port forwarding, many more)

## Connecting to saxon

* Everyone (registered) should have a visitor account of the stats servers now
* Try to connect to make sure everything is working...
* Replace cr173 with *your* netid
* The password is your usual password

```
$ ssh cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu
The authenticity of host 'saxon.stat.duke.edu (152.3.7.55)' can't be established
.
RSA key fingerprint is 74:30:5a:d0:cd:a8:d2:6f:a6:e9:c6:80:bb:eb:b4:ba.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?yes
cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu's password:
[cr173@saxon ~]$
```

## Working remotely

You should now be able to run commands remotely on `saxon`. We can interactively run commands on the remote system. Try `hostname` to see which system you are connected to, and `whoami` to see your user name.

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ hostname
saxon.stat.duke.edu
cr173@saxon [~]$ whoami
cr173
```

## Finishing up

Once you are done on the server you can exit by:

* Typing `exit` on the command line
* Ctrl-D
* Wait long enough (connection will time out)


## ssh alternative - mosh

mosh is an extension / wrapper to ssh that is designed to work in an environment where connections are not stable (ie. on a phone or laptop)

* mosh connections persist even if you 
    * close your laptop
    * lose your wifi connection
    * connect to a different network

<br/>

* You can install mosh using https://mosh.mit.edu/#getting
    * I recommend starting with the [Chrome version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mosh/ooiklbnjmhbcgemelgfhaeaocllobloj).



# Working remotely

## Why the shell

* Programmatically interact with OS (file system)
* Origins in the 1960s and 1970s
* "designed by computer scientists for computer scientists" 
* Evolution - interactive command language to scripting programming language
* "quick and dirty" prototyping


## Unix Design Philosophy

"Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools."


The UNIX Programming Environment, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike


## Why should you care?

* Power

* Reproducibility

  - Scripting is reproducible - clicking is not.

* Analysis pipelines



## Where am I? (pwd, ls, cd)

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ pwd
/home/vis/cr173
```

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ ls -l
total 5
drwx------+  2 cr173 visitor 11 Aug 25 19:53 mail
drwx------+  2 cr173 visitor  2 Dec 12 2011  Mail
drwxr-xr-x+  2 cr173 visitor  2 Aug 25 20:37 Sta523
```

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cd Sta523
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ pwd
/home/vis/cr173/Sta523
```

## Absolute vs relative paths

In unix paths can either be absolute or relative, and the difference is very important. For portability reasons you should almost always be using the latter.

Absolute path examples:

```
/var/ftp/pub
/etc/samba.smb.conf
/boot/grub/grub.conf
```

Relative path examples:

```
Sta523/filesystem/
data/access.log
filesystem/nelle/pizza.cfg
```



## Special directories {.smaller}

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -l
total 1
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor 2 Aug 25 20:41 filesystem
```

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -la
total 18
drwxr-xr-x+  3 cr173 visitor   3 Aug 25 20:41 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 69 cr173 visitor 104 Aug 25 20:37 ..
drwxr-xr-x+  2 cr173 visitor   2 Aug 25 20:41 filesystem
```

## Special directories (cont.) {.smaller}

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ cd .
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ pwd
/home/vis/cr173/Sta523
```

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ cd ..
cr173@saxon [~]$ pwd
/home/vis/cr173/
```


## Creating or Deleting directories

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cd Sta523
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -l
total 2
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor 2 Aug 25 20:41 filesystem
```

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ mkdir test
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -l
total 2
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor 2 Aug 25 20:41 filesystem
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor 2 Aug 25 20:44 test
```

##

```
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ rmdir test/
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -l
total 2
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor 2 Aug 25 20:41 filesystem
```

## Home directory and `~`

`~` is a special character that expands to the name of your home directory. If you append a user's login to `~`, it then refers to that user's home directory.

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ cd ~
cr173@saxon [~]$ pwd
/home/vis/cr173
```

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cd ~mc301
cr173@saxon [mc301]$ pwd
/home/fac/mc301
```


## Exercise

Connect to `saxon` and change to `Sta523/filesystem` directory in *my* home directory.

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cd ~cr173/Sta523/filesystem
```

Along with your neighbors, explore and map out all of the files and subdirectories that are contained within `filesystem`. It will probably be easiest to do this by drawing a tree on a piece of paper.



## Copying, moving and deleting (cp, mv, rm) {.smaller}

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:56 data
-rw-r--r--+ 1 cr173 visitor 88 Aug 25 21:07 haiku.txt                            
drwxr-xr-x+ 4 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:53 users
```

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ cp haiku.txt awesome_haiku.txt
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls -l
total 5
-rw-r--r--+ 1 cr173 visitor 88 Aug 25 21:07 awesome_haiku.txt
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:56 data
-rw-r--r--+ 1 cr173 visitor 88 Aug 25 21:07 haiku.txt
drwxr-xr-x+ 4 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:53 users
```

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ rm awesome_haiku.txt
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:56 data
-rw-r--r--+ 1 cr173 visitor 88 Aug 25 21:07 haiku.txt
drwxr-xr-x+ 4 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:53 users
```

## 

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ mv haiku.txt better_haiku.txt
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r--+ 1 cr173 visitor 88 Aug 25 21:07 better_haiku.txt
drwxr-xr-x+ 2 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:56 data
drwxr-xr-x+ 4 cr173 visitor  5 Aug 25 20:53 users
```

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ mv better_haiku.txt haiku.txt
```

## Wildcards and the shell

* `*` -  matches any number of characters in a filename, including none.
* `?` -  matches any single character.
* `[ ]` - set of characters that may match a single character at that position.
* `-` -   used within `[ ]` denotes a range of characters or numbers (eg. `[0-9]`).

More on this later when we discuss regular expressions

## 

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls data/
access.log  hardware.cfg  network.cfg
```

```
cr173@saxon [filesystem]$ ls data/*.cfg
data/hardware.cfg  data/network.cfg
```


## Examining files (cat, more, head, tail)

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cat ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt 
All night with no sleep
Caffeine your only partner
Damn thing still won't work
-chimera
```

##

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ head -n 2 ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt 
All night with no sleep
Caffeine your only partner
```

## 

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ tail -n 3 ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt 
Caffeine your only partner
Damn thing still won't work
-chimera
```

## Pipes

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ cat ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt | grep ^[AC]
All night with no sleep
Caffeine your only partner
```

## Oroborus cleverness

Want to see the 2nd line of the file and nothing else?

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ head -n 2 ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt | tail -n 1
Caffeine your only partner
```

What about the penultimate (2nd to last) line?

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ tail -n 2 ~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt | head -n 1
Damn thing still won't work
```


## Secure copy (scp) {.smaller}

Uses ssh to copy a file between systems. Lets grab a copy of `haiku.txt` for our local machine.

```
$ ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   2 rundel  staff    68 Aug 28 21:51 .
drwxr-xr-x  98 rundel  staff  3332 Aug 28 21:51 ..
$ scp cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu:~/Sta523/filesystem/haiku.txt ./
haiku.txt                                  100%   88     0.1KB/s   00:00    
$ cat haiku.txt 
All night with no sleep
Caffeine your only partner
Damn thing still won't work
-chimera
```

## Exercise

Create a *local* text file that contains your name and email address. Copy that file to your home directory on `saxon`.
