# Git Background

## Why version control? {.smaller}

<div class="centered" style="margin-top: -1em;">

</div>

## Why version control?

* Simple formal system for tracking all changes to a project

* Time machine for your projects
    * Track blame and/or praise
    * Remove the fear of breaking things

* Learning curve is steep, but when you need it you *REALLY* need it

## Why git?

* Distributed
    * Work online or offline
    * Collaborate with large groups

* Popular and Successful
    * Active development
    * Shiny new tools and ecosystems
    * Fast

* Tracks any type of file
    * Works best with text 

* Branching
    * Smarter merges

# Git Demo

## Some initial configuration {.smaller}

We want to let `git` know who we are so there are some simple configuration options we should setup.

Let's first tell `git` who we are, and what editor we want to use.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Colin Rundel"
$ git config --global user.email "rundel@gmail.com"
$ git config --global core.editor nano
```

We also want to set this up on saxon too, so

```bash
$ ssh cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu
cr173@saxon [~]$ git config --global user.name "Colin Rundel"
cr173@saxon [~]$ git config --global user.email "rundel@gmail.com"
cr173@saxon [~]$ git config --global core.editor nano
```

## Some initial configuration

Make sure to put this information in your github profile as well.

## Working with github {.smaller}

For the time being


## Cloning a repository

```bash
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ git clone https://github.com/Sta523-Fa16/git_example.git
Cloning into 'git_example'...
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

```bash
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls
git_example
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ ls -a git_example/
.  ..  .git  README.md
```

## Checking the status

```bash
cr173@saxon [Sta523]$ cd git_example
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

## Making changes

Lets edit the `README.md` file to include team member names and email addresses.

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ cat README.md
# git_example

Example repo
```

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ nano README.md
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ cat README.md
# git_example's Repo

## Team Members

* Colin Rundel - rundel@gmail.com
```

## Checking the status again

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Adding a new file {.smaller}

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ echo -e "* Add other team member's info\n* Fix formatting\n" > TODO
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ cat TODO
* Add other team member's info
* Fix formatting
```

## Checking the status yet again

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    TODO

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Lets save our changes

* One file `README.md` is tracked and modified (repo is already has this file but our current version differs from the previously saved version)

* The other file `TODO` is untracked (this file does not exist in the repo)

Our next step is the same for both files - we want to *stage* our changes using `git add`.

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git add README.md
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git add TODO
```

##

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   README.md
    new file:   TODO

```

## What is staging?

By using `git add` we have made git aware of the current version of both files, but we have not actually saved the changes yet.

To save the changes (locally) we need to *commit* them using `git commit`, since this change will be saved it is customary to add a message about the nature of the changes being made (for future reference).

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git commit -m "Added Colin's information to README; Added TODO file."
[master f9c548c] Added Colin's information to README; Added TODO file.
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 TODO
```

##

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

We've saved our changes but we're now out of sync with the repository on github.

## Making the problem worse

What if at the same time I was making these edits my teammate John Doe was making changes to `README.md` on github?

![github README edit](imgs/github_README_edit.png)

![github README commit](imgs/github_README_commit.png)

##

![github README status](imgs/github_README_status.png)

## Syncing repos

We can attempt to send our changes back to github by using `git push`

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git push
To git@github.com:Sta523-Fa16/git_example.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:Sta523-Fa16/git_example.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

## Merging remote changes

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From github.com:Sta523-Fa16/git_example
   6b79df7..804e091  master     -> origin/master
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

##

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

    both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

##

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ cat README.md 
git_example Repo
=======

## Team Members

<<<<<<< HEAD

* John Doe - j.doe@gmail.com
>>>>>>> 804e09178910383c128035ce67a58c9c1df3f558
```

* `<<<<<<<` - Indicates the start of the merge conflict.
* `=======` - Indicates the break point used for comparison. 
* `>>>>>>>` - Indicates the end of the lines that had a merge conflict.

## Resolving merge conflicts

Edit the merged file to reflect the changes you actually want.

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ nano README.md
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ cat README.md
git_example Repo
=======

## Team Members

```

## Stage and commit changes

```bash
cr173@saxon [git_example]$ git add README.md 
retBook-2:git_example rundel$ git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

Changes to be committed:

    modified:   README.md

$ git commit -m "Fix Merge conflict"
```
